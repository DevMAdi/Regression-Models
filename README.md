# Regression

This is a form of  _predictive modelling technique_  which investigates the relationship between a  **dependent**  (target) and  **independent**  variable (s) (predictor). This type of modelling is generally use to yield real value such as expected price of Apartment based on series of inputs such as location, neighbor, distance to market where former is  **dependent**  variable and later are  **independent**  variables.

This repo. contains regression models such as

-   **Simple Linear Regression**

> Estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one
> dependent variable using a straight line. Thus dataset must be
> linearly separable.

-   **Multiple Linear Regression**

> extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression that involves
> more than one explanatory(independent) variable.

-   **Polynomial Regression**

> relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent
> variable y is modelled as an nth degree **polynomial** in x.

-   **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

> uses support vector to generate real value and fit the best line
> within a predefined or threshold error value.

-   **Decision Tree Regression**

> models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into
> smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated
> decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree
> with decision nodes and leaf nodes.

-   **Random Forest Regression**
> an **ensemble learning** method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the prediction
